The OOP_Design_Pattern_Examples folder contains a collection of code examples showcasing different object-oriented design patterns in Python. The design patterns are divided into three categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral.

The CREATIONAL design patterns focus on creating objects in a structured and flexible way. The folder aims to includes examples of the:
- Factory Method pattern, 
- Abstract Factory pattern, 
- Builder pattern, 
- Singleton pattern, 
- Prototype pattern.

The STRUCTURAL design patterns provide a way to organize and structure classes and objects to form larger structures. The folder aims to includes examples of the:
- Adapter pattern, 
- Bridge pattern, 
- Composite pattern, 
- Decorator pattern, 
- Facade pattern, 
- Flyweight pattern, 
- Proxy pattern.

The BEHAVIORAL design patterns are used to manage algorithms, communication, and responsibility between objects. The folder aims to includes examples of the:
- Template Method pattern, 
- Chain of Responsibility pattern, 
- Command pattern, 
- Interpreter pattern, 
- Iterator pattern, 
- Mediator pattern, 
- Memento pattern, 
- Observer pattern, 
- State pattern, 
- Strategy pattern, 
- Visitor pattern, and more.

Each code example in the folder is well documented and includes an explanation of the pattern being demonstrated, its use cases, and benefits. By studying and implementing these design patterns, developers can improve the quality, flexibility, and scalability of their object-oriented code


Why learn about Design Patterns?
Knowing about design patterns can be beneficial in several ways:

1) Standardization: Design patterns provide a standardized approach to common software design problems, which can make it easier for developers to communicate and collaborate on projects.

2) Reusability: By using design patterns, developers can reuse proven solutions to common problems rather than starting from scratch. This can save time and effort in the development process.

3) Maintainability: Design patterns can help make code more modular and easier to maintain. This can be especially important as projects grow in size and complexity.

4) Performance: Some design patterns are specifically designed to improve performance or reduce resource usage. Using these patterns can help optimize code and improve overall system performance.

5) Industry standards: Many design patterns have become industry standards, and knowledge of these patterns can be valuable for developers seeking to stay up-to-date with current best practices and trends.

Overall, understanding and using design patterns can lead to more efficient and effective software development, better code quality
